## Gwendolyn Edgar

Gwen is a software engineer for biotech startup Nirrin Analytics. They graduated from MIT in 2019 with a Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with a minor in Comparative Media Studies. 

Gwen is interested in human-computer/machine interactions especially with the use of XR. They have worked on systems utilizing interactions between humans and machines to deliver a novel experiance in Tokyo and at MIT in visual augmented reality, audio augmented reality, virtual reality, and haptic systems. 


## Experience

### Nirrin Analytics, Spring 2019 - Now  
<img src="nirrin.png" alt="Nirrin Analytics" width="100"/>
<details>
 I work at a startup called Nirrin Analytics striving to improve research and production of protein based drugs through real time analytics of bioreactor contents using NIR lasers and advanced modeling.  I design, implement, review, and debug software solutions and modeling.  In this past year, I have independently developed and currently maintain a significant portion of our codebase. Since Nirrin is a small company, I have worked on security, networks, databases, APIs and overall infrastructure. It has been a very rewarding experience to learn and build on multiple aspects of a product.

<details>
I worked as a full stack engineer with a Boston based startup, Fritz AI, that was creating a platform to run machine learning algorithms locally on a mobile device as well as a system to evaluate the developer’s learning models. During my time at Fritz, I implemented multiple features and helped with the company's launch.

### MIT Game Lab UROP, Spring 2018

<details>
In my junior year, I joined the MIT Game Lab, where I worked on CLEVR, Collaborative Learning Environment in Virtual Reality, headed by Philip Tan and funded by a grant from the Oculus Story Studio. CLEVR was a mostly student designed educational game promoting cell understanding in highschool biology through "in person" discovery and collaboration between two students - one in virtual reality and one on a companion device. In this project, I participated in the design discussions, built parts and user tested the game, building upon input in further iterations. This was a very rewarding experience for me as I developed both technical and collaboration skills.

 We've been making clothing the same way since 1860 using inflexible tissue paper designs. Our application scales and superimposes clothing patterns on fabric, greately simplifying making clothes.

### H2L, Summer 2017

<details>
 In my sophomore year, I reached out to a startup company in Japan working to 'touch' the virtual world - H2L. My application was accepted and that summer I moved to Japan to work with them. At H2L,  I worked under Dr. Emi Tamaki, an associate professor at Waseda University to spearhead an inhouse project centered around sharing experiences between a human and a robot (Nao) using their haptic sensor and feedback system (Unlimited Hand) and augmented reality (Microsoft Hololens). I designed and built a system enabling a human to control and receive input from Nao in a natural way. My system understood how the human moved their head and what gestures they performed. It then piped this information to Nao, whose head and arms moved in a similar way as the human’s.  At the same time, the human could see through Nao’s eyes,  receiving live feedback through a video feed projected on the Hololens. My proof of concept was a success and Professor Tamaki advanced work on this project after I left with different robotic systems.
