## Projects

### Audio Only Augmented Reality Platformer Game with BoseAR

### CLEVR: Collaborative Learning Environments in Virtual Reality
https://education.mit.edu/project/clevr/

### Avatar VR
- My main role in the project was the interface the user experianced. How did they interact in the world? How could we make the experiance feel natural? How could we make each motion unique and capture the essence of different elements - flow for water, force for fire, rotation for air, and lines for earth. 
- I helped design the puzzles a little, but spent a lot of time with getting manipulations from the oculus controllers and finding what data we needed to look for to read each interaction.
